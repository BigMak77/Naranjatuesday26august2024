# Risk Assessment Manager Overhaul - COMPLETE ✅

## Date: 18 October 2025

## Overview

Successfully overhauled the RiskAssessmentManager component to add automatic risk rating calculation based on severity and likelihood, along with a comprehensive risk matrix visualization.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**File Created:** `add-likelihood-to-turkus-risks.sql`

- Added `likelihood` column (INTEGER, 1-5 scale) with CHECK constraint
- Added `risk_rating` column as a **calculated/generated column**
  - Formula: `Severity Numeric × Likelihood`
  - Range: 1-25
  - Stored automatically by database
- Added column comments for documentation
- Migration updates existing records with default likelihood value (3)

**Risk Rating Scale:**
```
Severity Scale:
- Low = 1
- Medium = 3
- High = 4
- Critical = 5

Likelihood Scale:
- 1 = Rare
- 2 = Unlikely
- 3 = Possible
- 4 = Likely
- 5 = Almost Certain

Risk Rating = Severity × Likelihood (1-25)
```

---

### 2. Frontend Component Updates

**File Modified:** `src/components/healthsafety/RiskAssessmentManager.tsx`

#### A. Type Definitions
```typescript
type TurkusRisk = {
  // ...existing fields
  likelihood: number;      // 1-5 scale
  risk_rating: number;    // Calculated: severity_numeric × likelihood
};
```

#### B. Helper Functions Added

1. **getSeverityNumeric(sev: string): number**
   - Converts severity text to numeric value (1, 3, 4, or 5)

2. **calculateRiskRating(sev: string, like: number): number**
   - Calculates risk rating: severity_numeric × likelihood

3. **getRiskLevel(rating: number): string**
   - Determines risk level from rating:
     - 1-5: Low
     - 6-12: Medium
     - 13-16: High
     - 17-25: Critical

4. **getRiskColor(rating: number): string**
   - Returns color code for risk rating:
     - Green (#00ff00): Low (1-5)
     - Yellow (#ffff00): Medium (6-12)
     - Orange (#ff9900): High (13-16)
     - Red (#ff0000): Critical (17-25)

5. **getLikelihoodLabel(like: number): string**
   - Converts numeric likelihood to descriptive label

#### C. Risk Matrix Visualization

Added interactive **5×4 Risk Matrix** in list view:

**Features:**
- Color-coded cells showing all possible risk ratings (1-25)
- **Count badges** on cells showing number of assessments in each category
- Hover tooltips showing risk count
- Legend explaining color coding
- Responsive design with horizontal scroll for mobile

**Layout:**
```
        Likelihood →
Severity ↓   1    2    3    4    5
Critical     5   10   15   20   25
High         4    8   12   16   20
Medium       3    6    9   12   15
Low          1    2    3    4    5
```

#### D. Enhanced Table View

**New Columns:**
- **Likelihood**: Shows descriptive label (e.g., "Possible")
- **Risk Rating**: Shows color-coded badge with numeric rating and risk level

**Example:**
```
Rating: [12] (Medium)  ← Yellow badge
```

#### E. Improved Create/Edit Form

**New Fields:**
1. **Severity Dropdown** - Updated with numeric indicators:
   - Low (1)
   - Medium (3)
   - High (4)
   - Critical (5)

2. **Likelihood Dropdown**:
   - 1 - Rare
   - 2 - Unlikely
   - 3 - Possible
   - 4 - Likely
   - 5 - Almost Certain

3. **Risk Rating Preview Panel**:
   - Shows live calculation as user selects severity/likelihood
   - Color-coded badge with risk rating
   - Displays risk level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
   - Shows calculation formula: "3 (Severity) × 4 (Likelihood) = 12"

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Only severity field (text-based)
- No visual indication of risk level
- No way to assess likelihood
- Manual risk assessment required

### After
- ✅ Severity + Likelihood fields (numeric scales)
- ✅ Automatic risk rating calculation
- ✅ Visual risk matrix showing all assessments
- ✅ Real-time risk rating preview
- ✅ Color-coded risk indicators throughout UI
- ✅ Count badges showing distribution of risks
- ✅ Clear risk level labels (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Automatic Calculation
The `risk_rating` is a **generated/computed column** in the database, meaning:
- ✅ Always accurate (can't get out of sync)
- ✅ No need to update manually
- ✅ Automatically recalculated when severity or likelihood changes
- ✅ Indexed for fast queries
- ✅ Can be used in WHERE clauses and ORDER BY

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing risk assessments get default likelihood = 3 (Possible)
- Frontend handles missing likelihood values gracefully
- Risk rating calculated client-side if not in database (fallback)

---

## SQL Migration Instructions

To apply the database changes:

```sql
-- Run this SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor or psql:
\i add-likelihood-to-turkus-risks.sql
```

Or manually:

```sql
-- 1. Add likelihood column
ALTER TABLE turkus_risks 
ADD COLUMN likelihood INTEGER DEFAULT 3 
CHECK (likelihood >= 1 AND likelihood <= 5);

-- 2. Add risk_rating calculated column
ALTER TABLE turkus_risks 
ADD COLUMN risk_rating INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
  CASE 
    WHEN severity = 'Low' THEN 1
    WHEN severity = 'Medium' THEN 3
    WHEN severity = 'High' THEN 4
    WHEN severity = 'Critical' THEN 5
    ELSE 3
  END * COALESCE(likelihood, 3)
) STORED;

-- 3. Update existing records
UPDATE turkus_risks SET likelihood = 3 WHERE likelihood IS NULL;
```

## Risk Rating Matrix Reference

| Severity / Likelihood | Rare (1) | Unlikely (2) | Possible (3) | Likely (4) | Almost Certain (5) |

| **Critical (5)**      | 5 (L)    | 10 (M)       | 15 (M)       | 20 (H)     | 25 (C)             |
| **High (4)**          | 4 (L)    | 8 (M)        | 12 (M)       | 16 (H)     | 20 (H)             |
| **Medium (3)**        | 3 (L)    | 6 (M)        | 9 (M)        | 12 (M)     | 15 (M)             |
| **Low (1)**           | 1 (L)    | 2 (L)        | 3 (L)        | 4 (L)      | 5 (L)              |

**Legend:**
- (L) = Low Risk (1-5) - Green
- (M) = Medium Risk (6-12) - Yellow
