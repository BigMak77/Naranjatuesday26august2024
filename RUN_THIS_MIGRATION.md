## ‚úÖ What This Migration Does

1. **Adds 3 new columns to `user_assignments`:**
   - `follow_up_due_date` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When the follow-up is due
   - `follow_up_completed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When the follow-up was completed
   - `follow_up_required` (BOOLEAN) - Whether follow-up is needed

2. **Adds helpful comments** to document each column

3. **Creates indexes** for fast queries:
   - Index for overdue follow-ups
   - Index for required follow-ups

4. **Shows verification** - Lists the new columns to confirm they were added
