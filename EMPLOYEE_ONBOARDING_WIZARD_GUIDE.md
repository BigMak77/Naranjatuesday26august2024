## Best Practices

### For Single Employees
1. Use when adding 1-2 employees
2. Need full customization
3. Want to review all options
4. Special permissions required

### For Bulk Import - Manual Entry
1. 2-10 employees
2. Direct data entry
3. Common roles/departments
4. Use "Copy from Previous" for efficiency

### For Bulk Import - Paste from Spreadsheet
1. Data already in Excel/Google Sheets
2. Quick ad-hoc imports
3. 5-50 employees
4. No need to save/export CSV

### For Bulk Import - CSV Upload
1. 10+ employees
2. Regular bulk imports
3. Data from other systems
4. Need to keep audit trail of import files

## Tips & Tricks

### Speed Up Bulk Entry
- Use "Copy from Previous" in manual table
- Prepare spreadsheet template in advance
- Use consistent naming for departments/roles
- Include all optional fields for complete profiles

### Avoid Common Errors
- **Employee numbers** - Ensure they're unique before import
- **Email addresses** - Check for typos (common source of failures)
- **Date formats** - Use YYYY-MM-DD for best compatibility
- **Department/role names** - Must match exactly (case-insensitive)

### Maximize Success Rate
1. Download and review the CSV template
2. Validate email addresses externally first
3. Check for duplicate employee numbers
4. Ensure department/role names match system
5. Test with 2-3 employees first

## Troubleshooting

### "Email already exists"
- Check if employee was previously added
- Look in archived/inactive employees
- Contact admin to remove duplicate

### "Employee number already exists"
- Use system to find existing employee with that number
- Assign new employee a different number
- Check for typos in employee number

### "Department/Role not found"
- Exact name doesn't match system
- Will be left blank for manual assignment later
- Check department/role lists in system
- Use manual entry method for precise selection

### "Welcome email failed"
- Employee still created successfully
- Email may be invalid/bouncing
- Check email service configuration
- Can resend invitation manually

### "Some employees failed to create"
- Review error messages for each failure
- Common causes: duplicate data, missing required fields
- Fix issues and re-import failed employees
- Successfully created employees don't need re-import
