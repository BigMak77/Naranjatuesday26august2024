### 2. ✅ **Enhanced Manager Toolbar**
- **Fixed:** Dropdown links now properly filtered based on access level and department
- **Added:** Real-time permission checking with `usePermissions` hook

- **Improved:** Loading states, error handling, and user feedback

### 3. ✅ **Department-Based Access Control**
- **Implemented:** Smart filtering based on user's assigned department
- **Added:** Validation for department-required sections
- **Enhanced:** Clear messaging for users without department assignments

## 🛡️ **Security Improvements**
