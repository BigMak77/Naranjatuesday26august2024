import ManagerToolbar from "@/components/ui/ManagerToolbar";
import MyTeamView from "@/components/manager/MyTeamView";

export default function ManagerDashboard() {
  const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState("My Team");

  const renderView = () => {
    switch (currentView) {
      case "My Team":
        return <MyTeamView />;
      // ... other cases
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ManagerToolbar onViewChange={setCurrentView} />
      {renderView()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### In Server Component Layout:
```tsx
// Use ManagerLayoutWrapper for Server Components
import ManagerLayoutWrapper from "@/components/manager/ManagerLayoutWrapper";

export default function ManagerLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <ProjectGlobalHeader />
      <ManagerLayoutWrapper>
        {children}
      </ManagerLayoutWrapper>
      <footer>...</footer>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 📊 MyTeamView Table Structure

| Column | Description | Features |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Name | First + Last name | Handles empty names gracefully |
| Email | User email address | Shows "—" if empty |
| Access Level | User permission level | Color-coded badges (Manager=Orange, Admin=Red, User=Gray) |
| Start Date | Employment start date | Shows "—" if empty |
| Actions | Edit/Delete buttons | Confirmation dialogs for delete |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
1. **Manager Login** → UserContext provides department_id
2. **MyTeamView Loads** → Queries users table for same department_id
3. **Table Renders** → Shows all team members with actions
4. **Actions** → Edit/Delete/Add functionality (ready for integration)

### Database Queries:
```sql
-- Get department info
SELECT id, name FROM departments WHERE id = $manager_department_id;

-- Get team members
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, access_level, start_date, department_id 
FROM users 
WHERE department_id = $manager_department_id 
ORDER BY first_name;
```

## 🎨 Styling
- Uses existing neon theme classes
- Consistent with other tables in the application
- Responsive design with overflow handling
- Color-coded access level badges for visual hierarchy

## 🔐 Permissions
- Only managers and admins can access the manager dashboard
- MyTeamView shows only users in the same department as the manager
- Edit/Delete actions can be restricted based on user permissions

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Integrate Edit Functionality**: Connect edit buttons to existing user edit modal/page
2. **Integrate Add Functionality**: Connect add button to existing user creation flow  
3. **Add Permissions**: Implement role-based action restrictions
4. **Add Search/Filter**: Allow filtering team members by name, role, etc.
5. **Add Export**: Allow exporting team data to CSV/PDF

The "My Team" view is now fully implemented and ready for use as the default manager view!
