# History.replaceState() Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing the following error:
```
SecurityError: Attempt to use history.replaceState() more than 100 times per 10 seconds
```

This error occurs when there are excessive navigation calls within a short time period, typically caused by:
1. Infinite re-render loops
2. Router objects in useEffect dependency arrays
3. Rapid navigation state changes
4. Competing access control redirects

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Infinite Redirect Loop in HR Structure Page
**File:** `src/app/hr/structure/page.tsx`
**Issue:** `useEffect` had `router` in dependency array, causing infinite re-renders
**Fix:** Removed `router` from dependency array and implemented safe router

### 2. Excessive Query String Updates in Audit Manager
**File:** `src/components/audit/AuditManager.tsx`
**Issue:** `handleTabChange` callback had `router` in dependencies, causing excessive `replaceState` calls
**Fix:** Implemented debounced router calls with safe router hook

### 3. Access Control Navigation Loops
**Files:** 
- `src/components/RequireAccess.tsx`
- `src/components/AccessControlWrapper.tsx`
**Issue:** Multiple access control components with `router` in useEffect dependencies
**Fix:** Removed `router` from dependency arrays and added debounced navigation

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Safe Router Hook
**File:** `src/lib/useRouterSafe.ts`
**Features:**
- Rate limiting (tracks calls per 10-second window)
- Debouncing (prevents rapid successive calls)
- Automatic delays when approaching the 100-call limit
- Drop-in replacement for Next.js useRouter

### 2. Updated Critical Components
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced `useRouter` with `useRouterSafe` in problematic components
- Removed `router` from useEffect dependency arrays where it was causing loops
- Added appropriate debounce delays for different types of navigation

### 3. Added Safety Mechanisms
**Features:**
- Call counting and timing tracking
- Progressive delays when approaching limits
- Cleanup of pending navigation calls
- Fallback to original router when immediate action is needed

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/useRouterSafe.ts` - New safe router hook
2. `src/app/hr/structure/page.tsx` - Fixed infinite redirect
3. `src/components/audit/AuditManager.tsx` - Added debounced tab changes
4. `src/components/RequireAccess.tsx` - Safe access control navigation
5. `src/components/AccessControlWrapper.tsx` - Safe access control navigation
6. `src/lib/test-router-safety.ts` - Test utilities

## Testing

### How to Verify the Fix
1. Navigate rapidly between tabs in the audit manager
2. Access restricted pages with different user roles
3. Use the HR structure page redirection
4. Monitor browser console for the SecurityError

### Expected Behavior
- No more "history.replaceState() more than 100 times" errors
- Smooth navigation with appropriate delays when needed
- Maintained functionality with improved stability

## Prevention Guidelines

### For Future Development
1. **Never include `router` in useEffect dependency arrays** unless absolutely necessary
2. **Use the safe router hook for any programmatic navigation**
3. **Debounce rapid navigation changes** (tabs, filters, etc.)
4. **Avoid competing redirects** in access control components
5. **Test navigation-heavy features** thoroughly

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Check for `router` in useEffect dependencies
- [ ] Look for rapid setState calls that trigger navigation
- [ ] Verify access control components don't compete
- [ ] Test with different user roles and permissions
- [ ] Monitor browser console during testing

## Performance Impact
- Minimal impact on normal navigation
- Slight delays (100-1000ms) only when approaching rate limits
- Improved overall stability and user experience
- Prevents browser security errors and crashes

## Status Update - October 28, 2025

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

All identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Safe router hook created and implemented
- ✅ HR structure page infinite loop fixed
- ✅ Audit manager debouncing implemented
- ✅ Access control components updated
- ✅ Router dependency issues resolved

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the application thoroughly in development
2. Monitor for any remaining navigation errors
3. Deploy to staging for further testing
4. Consider implementing similar patterns for other navigation-heavy components

**Confidence Level:** High - All known causes of the SecurityError have been addressed with robust, backward-compatible solutions.
